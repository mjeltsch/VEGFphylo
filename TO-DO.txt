When adding a new synonym, it needs to added to two files!!! To the master_dictionary.py and taxon_data.py. And it needs to added at multiple places (for each taxon once in the taxon_data.py file)
It should only be necessary to add it once to one file!

Automatic downloading of GI list files!

When a species cannot be found from NCBI taxonomy database, amn error is generated (the renaming of e.g. Achalarus lyciades does this at the moment).
The fix is to add the species data (scientific name, taxon_id and phylum) manually to the sqlite3 database.
